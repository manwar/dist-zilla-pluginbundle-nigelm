NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::NIGELM - Build your distributions like I do

VERSION
    version 0.12

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

      [@NIGELM]
      dist = Distribution-Name
      repository_at = github

DESCRIPTION
    This is the Dist::Zilla configuration I use to build my distributions.
    It was originally based on the @FLORA bundle but additionally pulls in
    ideas from @MARCEL bundle.

    It is roughly equivalent to:

        [Git::NextVersion]
            first_version  = 0.01,
            version_regexp = release/(\d+.\d+)

        [ReadmeAnyFromPod]
            type = pod
            filename = README.pod
            location = root
        [InstallGuide]
        [Manifest]
        [Git::Commit]
        [Git::Tag]
        [Git::CommitBuild]
            branch =
            release_branch = cpan
        [Git::Push]
        [CheckChangeLog]
        [UploadToCPAN] or [FakeRelease]

  Tweakables
   authority
    The authority for this distribution - defaults to "cpan:NIGELM"

   no_cpan
    If "no_cpan" or the environment variable "NO_CPAN" is set, then the
    upload to CPAN is suppressed.

   tag_format / tag_message / version_regexp / git_autoversion
    Overrides the Git bundle defaults for these. By default I use an unusual
    tag format of "release/%v" for historical reasons. If git_autoversion is
    true (the default) then the version number is taken from git.
