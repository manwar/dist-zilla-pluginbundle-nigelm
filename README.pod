=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::NIGELM - Build your distributions like I do

=head1 VERSION

version 0.11

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [@NIGELM]
  dist = Distribution-Name
  repository_at = github

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the L<Dist::Zilla> configuration I use to build my
distributions. It was originally based on the @FLORA bundle but
additionally pulls in ideas from @MARCEL bundle.

It is roughly equivalent to:

    [Git::NextVersion]
        first_version  = 0.01,
        version_regexp = release/(\d+.\d+)
    [Git::Check]
    [GatherDir]
    [CompileTests]

    [MetaTests]
    [PodCoverageTests]
    [PodSyntaxTests]
    [PodSpellingTests]
    [KwaliteeTests]
    [PortabilityTests]
    [SynopsisTests]
    [MinimumVersionTests]
    [HasVersionTests]
    [DistManifestTests]
    [UnusedVarsTests]
    [NoTabsTests]
    [EOLTests]
    [InlineFiles]
    [ReportVersions]
    [PruneCruft]
    [PruneFiles]
        filenames = dist.ini
    [ManifestSkip]
    [AutoPrereqs]
    [MetaConfig]
    [MetaResources]
    [Authority]
        authority   = cpan:NIGELM
        do_metadata = 1,
    [ExtraTests]
    [NextRelease]
    [PkgVersion]
    [PodWeaver]
        config_plugin = @MARCEL
    [License]
    [MakeMaker]
    [MetaYAML]
    [MetaJSON]
    [ReadmeAnyFromPod]
        type = pod
        filename = README.pod
        location = root
    [InstallGuide]
    [Manifest]
    [Git::Commit]
    [Git::Tag]
    [Git::CommitBuild]
        branch =
        release_branch = cpan
    [Git::Push]
    [CheckChangeLog]
    [UploadToCPAN] or [FakeRelease]

=head2 Tweakables

=head3 authority

The authority for this distribution - defaults to C<cpan:NIGELM>

=head3 no_cpan

If C<no_cpan> or the environment variable C<NO_CPAN> is set, then
the upload to CPAN is suppressed.

=head3 tag_format / tag_message / version_regexp / git_autoversion

Overrides the Git bundle defaults for these. By default I use an
unusual tag format of C<release/%v> for historical reasons. If
git_autoversion is true (the default) then the version number is
taken from git.
